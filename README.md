# Semester project 2

![Image of live site](media/live-site.png)

This site was my delivery for the second-year semester project at Noroff. The purpose of this project was to create an auction site using bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript. The site had to be responsive and get and post data to and from the Noroff API. 

## Description

The requirements for this project were as follows:

- A user with a "stud.noroff.no" email address should be able to register and log in to the site.
- A registered user can login and logout
- A registered user can update their avatar
- A registered user can view their total credit
- A registered user can create an auction
- A registered user can bid on other user's auctions
- A registered user can view bids made on an auction
- An unregistered user can search trough listings

Here you can detail any information you want to provide regarding contributing to the project. For big projects you will usually have a separate CONTRIBUTING.md and link to it, but for smaller projects you can simply include instructions here. These instructions can simply detail the process you want a person to take, such as to make sure to open a pull request so code can be reviewed.

License

You can link to your license file here if you're using one, or mention what license the codebase falls under. If you're unsure then you can simply delete this section.
