# Semester project 2
This repository contains my delivery for Semester project 2.

## About this project

This project is part of my second year front end studies at Noroff. The goal for this project was to show what we have learned during the last 3 semesters and build an online auction site for noroff students using an API setup by the school to register users, listings and bids. 

### Requirements for this project:

- Build a site using pre approved tools and technologies like: 
  - An approved CSS framework (I used Bootstrap)
  - An approved static host (I used github pages)
  - An approved design application (I used Adobe XD)
  - An approved Planning application (I used both Github projects and Trello)

- Required user stories:
  - A user with a @stud.noroff.no email may register
  - A registered user may login
  - A registered user may logout
  - A registered user may update their avatar
  - A registered user may view their total credit
  - A registered user may create a listing
  - A registered user may add a bid to a listing
  - A registered user may view bids made on a listing
  - An unregistered user may search trough listings

### Technologies used:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)
- [Vanilla JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
